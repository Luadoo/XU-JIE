1. Title:  Traffic Sign Classification with Keras and Deep Learning

     In this project, you will learn how to train your own traffic sign classifier/recognizer capable of obtaining over 95% accuracy using Keras and Deep Learning.
   
2.   I will show the contents of the project：

     1）Keras: High-level neural networks API. Makes coding, training, and deploying neural networks
 Incredibly easy with its scikit-learn style API.
 
     2）Regression with Keras:
     
                        workon traffic_signs
                        Pip install opencv-contrib-python
                        Pip install numpy
                        Pip install scikit-learn
                        Pip install scikit-image
                        Pip install imutils
                        Pip install matplotlib
                        Pip install tensorflow==2.0.0 # or tensorflow-gpu 
                        
      3）OpenCV:  Most used computer vision library.Highly efficient.Facilitates real-time image processing.
      
         imutils:  My collection of helper functions and utilities to make working with Open CV easier.
         
         Numpy --> TensorFlow2.0.0 : open source machine learning library. Often used for neural networks, deep learning, and as a computational backend for Keras.
         
         Scikit-learn : Machine learning in Python. Simple. Efficient.Beautiful, easy to use API.
         
         Scikit-image : Collection of algorithms for image processing. Contains some algorithm implementations that Open CV does not.
         
         Matplotlib :  The de facto plotting package for python.
